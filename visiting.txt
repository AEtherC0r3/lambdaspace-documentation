Visiting Lambdaspace

Lambdaspaces aims to be an open community, where all creatures are welcome. Unfortunately there still needs to be someone in the hackerspace to actually open the space. Currently there is no fixed time when the space is open, although most Saturdays someone is home. If you are looking for a good time to come by just visit http://community.lambdaspace.gr and pick an event of your choosing. Most events are organized from at least one member of the space, so it is a good time to get into contact with Lambdaspace.

If you are feeling more spontaneous, you can check our live-status indicator and see if the space is currently open. You can find the indicator on the top of our page or on Twitter (@techmin_status).
Visitors are welcome to make use of the kitchen, the living room area and the working area, as long as the space is open. The presentation area, the laboratory, as well as any equipment belonging to the hackerspace, can only be accessed and used by the members of the hackerspace.


So feel free to come and visit us, we are looking forward to meeting you!
